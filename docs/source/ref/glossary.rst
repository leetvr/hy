Glossary
========

Hytopia lets you to a lot, and so is a complex system with a lot of moving
parts.

Throughout this documentation we try to use words consistently: so you can be
sure that when we talk about an :term:`entity`, we always mean the same thing.

This page lists all of the concepts that exist in Hy’s view of the world.

.. glossary::

 block
  a voxel (volume element) that makes up the terrain of a Hytopia :term:`world`

 block type
  every :term:`block` has a “type” which controls the behaviour and appearance
  of all blocks of that type

 entity
  an entity is a wizzle in the wozzle

 entity type
  every :term:`entity` has a “type” which controls the behaviour and appearance
  of all entities of that type. An entity type might define properties (for
  example, number of hitpoints), and each entity of that type can customise
  those properties

 game
  a game takes place in a :term:`world`. Usually it has a start, an end, some
  players, and some sort of high score... but it’s up to you!

 Hytopia Editor
  a web-based editor that lets you build worlds by placing
  :term:`blocks<block>`, :term:`entities<entity>`, and preview those worlds as
  they’ll be seen by your players.
 
 world
  the world is the virtual space in which a Hytopia :term:`game` happens. You
  can create worlds in the :term:`Hy Editor`, downloading pre-existing template
  worlds from the Marketplace, or play games in worlds that other content
  creators have made.

  The most important thing a  world contains are its :term:`block`s,
  :term:`entities<entity>` and its scripts; and it’s fully documented at **TO
  BE WRITTEN**.
