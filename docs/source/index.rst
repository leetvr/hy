Hy: the prototype for Hytopia
=============================

Hy is a prototype for Hytopiaâ€™s user-generated content (UGC) platform. This
documentation:

 * Explains what UGC is and why you should develop it (**TO BE WRITTEN
   [probably by Hytopia themselves]**)
 * Walks you through building your first :term:`world` and the :term:`game`
   inside it
 * Contains a comprehensive reference for everything in Hytopia (**TO BE
   WRITTEN**)
